Change Requests must be reviewed and approved before they can be applied to the database. You can also Approve a Change Request but not Apply it until an ideal maintenance window to make the database changes.

1. After a Change Request has been submitted, it is in the "Review Required" state
2. Any owner within the Organization may review and approve the Change Request
