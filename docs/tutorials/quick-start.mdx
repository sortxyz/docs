## Managing Data

### Proposing Changes

1. **Visit the Data Explorer:**  
   Use the `Explore` button or navigate to 'Data Explorer' via the left-hand menu.  

2. **Editing Existing Data:**  
   - Click the `Edit` button next to the row you want to modify.  
   - Suggest your changes, then create a **Change Request**.  

3. **Adding New Rows:**  
   - Scroll to the bottom of the table and click `Add Row`.  
   - Fill in the new data and submit a **Change Request**.

4. **Removing Data:**

### What Are Change Requests? üéâ

If you're familiar with GitHub Pull Requests, think of **Change Requests** as a similar workflow for making database changes.  
- **Approval Required:** Changes cannot be applied to the database until a team member approves them.  
- **Data Quality Matters:** By using **Change Requests**, Sort adopts software engineering best practices to ensure your data remains accurate and reliable.
