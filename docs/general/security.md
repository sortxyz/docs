### Certifications

Sort is currently working on various security certifications, and recommends not importing databases with high security requirements until the certifications are complete.

### Reporting security issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to responsibly disclose this and not open a public issue. We will investigate all legitimate reports. Email [security@sort.xyz](mailto:security@sort.xyz) to disclose any security vulnerabilities.
