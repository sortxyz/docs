Sort manages your data and teams by grouping them into organizations. Organizations include:

- Team members
- Database connections (with public or private visibility)
- Databases imported from database connections
- Billing

In addition, organizations have their own name, public url, and description. [Visit Sort's organization](https://sort.xyz/orgs/sort) to see an example.
